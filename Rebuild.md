 | Remediation efforts are based on intelligence gathered during IR. Using existing domain and  infrastructure, block known file and network based IOCs, rebuild compromised systems, reset know compromised accounts.       | Building of upon earlier concepts, while still using existing domain and infrastructure, begin to introduce modern security concepts during remediation efforts. Goal is to minimize impact if attacker re-enters network | Build a new domain, applications, and services on cloud based infrastructure and services. Quickly digitally transform the organizationâ€™s IT operations. Implement modern security concepts starting day 1.
