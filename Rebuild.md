 | Overview | Remediation efforts are based on intelligence gathered during IR. Using existing domain and  infrastructure, block known file and network based IOCs, rebuild compromised systems, reset know compromised accounts.       | Building of upon earlier concepts, while still using existing domain and infrastructure, begin to introduce modern security concepts during remediation efforts. Goal is to minimize impact if attacker re-enters network | Build a new domain, applications, and services on cloud based infrastructure and services. Quickly digitally transform the organizationâ€™s IT operations. Implement modern security concepts starting day 1.
 | Steps | <ul><li>Gather intelligence of attacker activity</li><li>Implement posturing recommendations</li><li>Harden Environment </li><li>Contain & Eradicate attacker: block IOCs, Password Resets, System rebuilds</li><li>Rebuild from backups</li><li>Monitor for the attacker returning</li></ul>|<ul><li>Enterprise password reset</li><li>MFA Externally facing systems</li><li>MFA for Admins</li><li>Network segmentation</li><li>AD Admin Tiers</li><li>Authentication Silos</li><li>Selective Authentication</li><li>Host-based firewalls</li></ul>| <ul><li>Select primary cloud provider</li><li>Prioritize applications based on rebuild in IaaS, SaaS, PaaS</li><li>Construct New Domain</li><li>Establish connectivity to cloud</li><li>Rebuild applications, import application data from old network</li><li>Implement modern security </li></ul>|
| Pros | <ul><li>Remediation efforts are expedited </li><li>Easy to plan remediation efforts (if proper intelligence is gathered) </li><li>Business can quickly focus on restoring business operations </li></ul>|<ul><li>Reduces impact of compromise re-compromised and resilient against future attackers </li><li>Addresses security gaps frequently exposed by attackers </li><li>Use existing technology to rebuild and secure network</li></ul>|<ul><li>Can rebuild in parallel of investigation efforts</li><li>Immediately introduce modern security concepts and strategies</li><li>Quickly acquire computing and storage resource via cloud based technologies</li></ul>
|Cons|<ul><li>High likelihood of network being re-compromised.</li><li>Requires lengthy analysis of incident to collect all known attacker IOCS </li><li>Attacker may still be present in the network or re-enter the network if all steps are not executed verbatim </li><li>Root cause of the compromise is not addressed </li></ul>|<ul><li>Recovery efforts prolonged by implementation of security controls </li><li>Rebuild efforts can be dependent upon security control beings completed </li><li>Administrators need to learn and support modern security concepts </li><li>Attacker may have access to the environment that may not be addressed by security controls</li></ul>|<ul><li>New skillset for administrators to learn</li><li>Adequate transition plan trumped by expedited rebuild effort </li><li>Sites require necessary bandwidth to access cloud resources </li><li>Some applications and services may not best be suited to be hosted in cloud </li></ul>
