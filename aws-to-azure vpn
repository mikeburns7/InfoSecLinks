Azure 
create vnet - create a vlan that is large enough for your vpc/resource group
    - create a frontend/backend subnets within this vnet
Create a gatewaysubnet - this is going to act like a transient vnet, so it just needs to be a small subnet
    ie 10.0.255/27
Create a virtual Public IP

Create a virtual network gateway - this is equivilent to a VPN appliance    

az network vnet-gateway create --gateway-type Vpn --location eastus --name hbfw-VnetGateway --no-wait --public-ip-addresses hbfw-vnetgatewayip --resource-group hbfw --sku Basic --vnet hbfw --vpn-type RouteBased


AWS
Build out VPC  -again a large subnet to support your build out
     create frontend/backend subnet within the VPC

Customer Gateway -  this is the non-aws side of the VPN. this could be your on-prem VPN appliance or cloud that you are peering with 

Create virutal private gateway - this is the AWS side (Anchor point) of the VPN connection

Create VPN connection - estabishes route to Azure
 - download configuration file


 Azure 
 - create local network gateway - this is establishing a route to Azure
 Create a local network gateway to represent the on-premises site that you want to connect to a virtual network. The local network gateway specifies the public IP address of the VPN device and IP address ranges located on the on-premises site. Later, create a VPN gateway connection between the virtual network gateway for the virtual network, and the local network gateway for the on-premises site. 

 az network local-gateway create -g hbfw p -n AWSLocalGateway --gateway-ip-address x.x.x.x--local-address-prefixes 172.31.0.0/16
 
 select site to site connection

 az network vpn-connection create -g hbfw -n AWSConnection --vnet-gateway1 hbfw-xxxx --local-gateway2 xxxxLocalGateway --shared-key xxxxxxxxx
